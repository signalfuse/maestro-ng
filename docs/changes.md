ChangeLog
=========

Maestro 0.7.1
-------------

_September 9th, 2019_

* Allow for passing additional Jinja2 filters to
  `loader.load_config_from_file()` (by @tedoc2000, #206).

Maestro 0.7.0
-------------

_April 17th, 2019_

* Bump minimum Docker API version requirement to 1.18 to support
  container labels.
* Handle public images correctly (by @sassrobi).

* Fixed some flake8 styling issues from previous changes.

Maestro 0.6.0
-------------

_November 23rd, 2018_

* Performance improvements by using PyYAML's CParser.
* Performance improvements by caching `get_link_variables()`
* when creating each container instance's environment variables
  (by @tedoc2000).
* Ability to define extra `/etc/hosts` entry by ship reference (requires
  the ship to be defined using a numeric IP address).
* Added check for duplicate service instances names across services.
* Fix for the output column width calculations (by @hgolson77).

Maestro 0.5.4
-------------

_August 6th, 2018_

* Apply registry retry policy to login attempts.

Maestro 0.5.3
-------------

_August 6th, 2018_

* Add retry policy support on image pulls.

Maestro 0.5.2
-------------

_July 5th, 2018_

* Add ability to run process inside container as a specific user.
* Nicer error output.
* Use a safe YAML loader.
* More fixes for Python3 compatibility.

Maestro 0.5.1
-------------

_May 23rd, 2018_

* Improve error messages when an expected service dependency is not
  defined in the YAML environment file.
* Fixes for Python3 compatibility.

Maestro 0.5.0
-------------

  hostnames/IP address instead of the logical ship name.
* Introduce `--expand-services` and `--all` command-line flags.
  When using `stop` or `restart` commands, the user will need to pass in
  `--expand-services` to convert service names in given arguments to
  container names of those services, or pass `--all` to force "no
  arguments" to mean "all containers". Otherwise, Maestro will exit with
  an error.

* Added `rexec` lifecycle check to execute commands within the target,
  remote container being checked (#169).
* Added support for ulimits at the service and container levels (#173
  and #174).
* Added `exec` auditor to execute a local script to record the audit
  event (#176).

There's always room for seconds.

* Fixed a Docker 1.9 API compatibility issue with -h/--net (#159).

Maestro 0.2.8
-------------

_November 25th, 2015_

The Thanksgiving release.

* Fixed a bug in parsing the start time of containers in some
  situations.
* Support specifying the Docker remote API version as a float.

Maestro 0.2.7
-------------

_September 14th, 2015_

This release contains lots of improvements to keep Maestro moving
forward and compatible with Docker and its fast-moving pace! Starting
from this release the documentation has also moved to ReadTheDocs.org
and will progressively be updated to fit into their page structure.

* Display image tag of the running image for running containers.
* Add support for `cap_add` and `cap_drop` parameters.
* Lots of Python3 compatibility fixes; using MaestroNG with Python3
  should now be possible.
* Use the same Jinja2 extensions and environment when reading an
  environment file from STDIN than when reading from file, allowing for
  the same references to environment variables and uses of includes.
* Rework auditing to track individual events (more verbose).
* Bump docker-py requirement to 1.3.0 and use a default Docker API
  version of 1.15 (instead of 1.10, which is no longer supported by the
  most recent versions of Docker).
* Control of the API version used when talking to a Docker daemon is now
  possible via the `api_version` parameter to the Ship's constructor.
* Add support for Docker logging drivers via the support of the
  `logconfig` parameters.
* Optimize `maestro logs` command, even continuing to follow the logs if
  the underlying container gets restarted.
* Fix concurrent pulling of the same image on the same ship.

Maestro 0.2.6.2
---------------

_May 26th, 2015_

This is the first MaestroNG release to be made available on the Python
Package Index. A few tweaks were made to make this possible:

* The pip package name was changed to `maestro-ng`. You might want to
  uninstall and re-install Maestro instead of upgrading to avoid
  conflicts.
* The package's README is now parsed and converted to reStructuredText
  in the `setup.py` so it displays correctly on PyPI.

The following Maestro changes are also included in this small
point-release:

* Use yaml.CLoader to speed up YAML parsing, when possible
* Display image SHA in `status -F` output of running containers

Maestro 0.2.6.1
---------------

_May 12th, 2015_

* guestutils: don't attempt to contact the Docker daemon running on the
  host for get_container_internal_address(). It's not guaranteed that
  the Docker daemon is available, or that it's even running on the
  default port via TCP. Rely on the `netifaces` module instead.
* Fix lifecycle script check execution when container environment
  contains non-string values.

Maestro 0.2.6
-------------

_May 1st, 2015_

With this release, MaestroNG switches from the GNU GPLv3 to the Apache
Software License v2, with permissions from the various contributors.

* The official Docker port, 2375, is now the default port used by
  Maestro.
* Improvements to the script execution as a lifecycle check; the script
  is executed multiple times until success or until the maximum number
  of attempts is reached, much like for TCP port pinging. The
  environment of the script also contains the environment variables the
  container would have when running.
* Fall back to looking up configured image registries by their FQDN
  (#93).
* Added support for `omit: true` on a service, which instructs Maestro
  not to act on this service in "unspecified" commands, unless of course
  the service is required for another one to run (#108).
* Fix documentation on Maestro's use of authentication credentials
  (#65).
* Fix output of `status -F` command where port status wouldn't be shown.
* Remove container volumes when removing containers (#122).
* Miscellanious flake8 and unit test fixups.

Maestro 0.2.5.1
---------------

_February 23rd, 2015_

Simple point-fix release to include the separation of main() and
execute() in the module entrypoint to make building scripts that execute
MaestroNG easier.

Maestro 0.2.5
-------------

_February 19th, 2015_

* Added support for specifying the container's work directory (#111)
* Improvements to the pull task so it correctly reports errors (#76)
* Improvements to error reporting by providing a meaningful traceback
* Allow connection to local Docker daemons via UNIX socket (#106, #113)
* Added basic JSON-sending webhook auditor (#118)
* Added support for `volumes_from` and container-only volumes (#114)
* Set `DOCKER_IMAGE` and `DOCKER_TAG` environment variables inside the
  started containers as running programs might find this information
  useful

Maestro 0.2.4.1
---------------

_December 12th, 2014_

This fix release introduces YAML file schema versioning, in particular
to ease the pain of the migration to Maestro >= 0.2.4. A new YAML
snippet can be added to your environment description file to specify the
version of the "schema" used to understand this YAML file by Maestro:

```yaml
__maestro:
  schema: 2
```

If you don't specify this information, Maestro will assume that you use
schema version 1, which in particular understands volume bindings the
"old way" (up to version 0.2.3).

Maestro 0.2.4
-------------

_December 12th, 2014_

**Note:** this release introduces a breaking change that will require a
change in your YAML environment files. Volume bindings must now be
specified as `/on/the/host: /inside/the/container`. This is reversed to
what Maestro used to do until now, but makes it be the same "direction"
than what Docker and `docker-py` use. See #74 for more details.

* Display improvements:
  - Fix completion output for the `pull` command when executed
    standalone
  - Simplified and colored port status in the detailed status output
  - Allow for the ship column to slim down all the way to not being
    displayed when the terminal is not wide enough
  - Display container running/down time in the detailed status output
  - Display each container's image tag in the output
* Added an `HttpRequestLifecycle` to implement lifecycle checks that
  perform an HTTP request, valid when getting a 200 response code
* Added support for container restart policies
* Added TLS/SSL support
* Support for re-using existing containers when starting or restarting
  them with the `--reuse` flag, as opposed to removing and recreating
  the container (fixes #92)
* Support for per-container image repository override
* Added a `--only-if-changed` flag to the `restart` command that will
  only restart the container if its image has changed after pulling it
  (fixes #62)
* Added support for read-only volume bindings (#74)

Maestro 0.2.3
-------------

_September 12th, 2014_

* Docker Links support (#21)
* Allow for forced colored output by setting the `ANSICON` environment
  variable, even if the terminal is not a tty (#72)
* New `pull` command that just performs the image pull/refresh without
  affecting the running containers (#71). Very useful in preparation of
  a rolling upgrade as it can be done with maximum parallelism
* Introduce `ship_defaults` section to provide defaults for ship
  attributes like `timeout` or SSH tunnel configuration (#73)
* Scaffolding for ship providers, default one is the static list of
  ships but more intelligent providers can be implemented, pulling from
  EC2 APIs for example
* Variable column width for container and ship name if the terminal size
  allows it
* Add support for docker -dns (#59)
* Add support for docker -net (#41)
* Add support for specifying a distinct ship endpoint address, used to
  talk to the Docker daemon (#67, #70)
* Fix bug in sleep lifecycle helper (#69)

Maestro 0.2.2
-------------

_July 22nd, 2014_

* Provide no-tty output without ANSI escape codes (output still looks a
  bit funky, but at least it's not riddle with unreadable escape codes)
* Fix "time ago" calculation that shows hours as days
* Correctly bubble up orchestration errors and exit with a non-zero
  returncode
* Fix install requirements when installing through setup.py (which pip
  does by default)

Maestro 0.2.1
-------------

_July 22nd, 2014_

* New pluggable audit trail functionality to send orchestration commands
  and results notifications to audit trail targets. Currently supports
  HipChat (via python-simple-hipchat) and log file
* Fix status orchestration play to not enforce dependency order as it's
  useless and slows it down
* Show how long a container has been up or down for

Maestro 0.2.0
-------------

_July 21st, 2014_

This release warrants jumping to the 0.2.x series as the extent of the
changes is significant and it contains some potentially breaking changes
in usage (not in the YAML format though).

* Major rework of the argument parser; each command now has its own
  subparser with appropriate arguments; one downside is that Maestro can
  now longer default to the 'status' command when no command is
  specified
* Maestro no longer assumes dependencies should be included in an
  orchestration play. Use `-d` or `--with-dependencies` to automatically
  include the dependencies of the given services/containers (#50)
* It is now possible to ignore the dependency order during an
  orchestration play by passing `-i` or `--ignore-dependencies` to the
  start, stop or restart commands
* Orchestration plays can now execute container operations in parallel,
  respecting the dependency order as needed and/or as requested.
  Additionally, a maximum concurrency limit can be specified with `-c`
  or `--concurrency-limit` to restrict the number of containers that can
  be acted upon at the same time. This can be used to implement rolling
  restarts for example
* Add `-v` / `--version` flag to show Maestro version
* New `deptree` commands that shows the dependency tree of each provided
  service or container (supports `-r` / `--recursive` to include
  duplicate indirect dependencies)
* Removed `fullstatus` command, replaced with `status -F`.
* Compatibility improvements with docker-py mainline and Docker versions
* Dropped support for `docker_endpoint` in ship configuration
* SSH tunneling support via `bgtunnel` on-demand SSH tunnels (#35, #44)
* Maestro now reads a maestro.yaml file from the current working
  directory instead of stdin by default. `-f -` can still be used to
  read from stdin (#47)
* Include workaround for Python multiprocessing bug in Python < 2.7.5
  (#48)
* Implement simple 'sleep' lifecycle check that simply sleeps for the
  given amount of time
* Changed `cmd` to `command` in YAML instance spec. `cmd` is still
  accepted but deprecated and will be removed in the next release (part
  of #39)

Maestro 0.1.8.1
---------------

_May 30th, 2014_

* Fixed link variable naming for port names containing dashes

Maestro 0.1.8
-------------

_May 28th, 2014_

* Support for custom image command
* Implement restart Maestro command
* Add support for "soft" dependencies through `wants_info`. Containers
  get the link environment variable, but the dependency has no impact on
  the start/stop orders
* Improve guestutils service matching by including a list of each
  service's instances as a `<service_name>_INSTANCES` environment
  variable

Maestro 0.1.7.1
---------------

_April 28th, 2014_

* Support for memory and cpu shares limits
* Fix image:tag parsing when custom registries are involved
* Improve Jinja2 setup to include filesystem loader and with extension
  for more flexible and complex Jinja2 templating capabalities

Maestro 0.1.7
-------------

_April 9th, 2014_

* Use `docker-py` 0.3.x
* Deep expend of environment variables list values
* Pre-processing of the YAML environment description through Jinja2
  templating
* Correctly pass-in specified volumes to create_container() in case the
  image's Dockerfile didn't define them
* Support service-level environment variables that trickle down to all
  instances of the service
* Documentation improvements, flake8 and unit-test fixes
* Support for privileged containers
* Support for timeout on container stop


Maestro 0.1.6
-------------

_January 30th, 2014_

* Fullstatus output now shows port numbers
* Improved port specification syntax for more precise control about
  internal and exposed ports and interfaces
* Maestro extension for logstash-based logging scaffolding
* Docker and `docker-py` compatibility fixes (Id/ID, `docker-py` API
  tweaks)
* Show image being pulled when creating a container

Maestro 0.1.5
-------------

_January 16th, 2014_

* Fix download indicator for compatibility with Docker 0.7.x
* Renamed 'status' command to 'fullstatus', and implemented new, faster
  'status' command that only looks at the state of the containers, not
  the services themselves
* Sort containers before building dependencies to try to keep them a bit
  more organized without breaking the dependency order
* Don't use white in commands output, just bold text
* Compatibility fixes with docker-py 0.2.3
* The 'logs' command now streams logs instead of dumping them, until you
  hit ^C to stop
* Implement registry login before pull, when needed and if possible
* Renamed 'scores' to 'plays', makes more sense
* Updates to the 'logs' command:
  - by default, the 'logs' command now dumps the full log and doesn't
    stream/follow
  - with the '-F' flag, logs will be followed
  - the new '-n N' flag will only show the last N lines of the log, but
    it doesn't work with streaming logs
* Setup for Travis-CI build with flake8 validation

Maestro 0.1.4
-------------

_December 9th, 2013_

* Optimize status score by not polling the service if the container is
  down (it can't be running then)
* Add guest helper function to retrieve the internal IP address of the
  container

Maestro 0.1.3
-------------

_December 6th, 2013_

* Download progress indicator when pulling an image
* Correctly exit with a non-zero exit code on error through better
  exception handling and reporting
* Removed the useless -v/--verbose option
* Bugfixes and code cleanups

Maestro 0.1.2
-------------

_November 25th, 2013_

* Seamless understanding of parameters as either containers or services
  for all operations
* Independent control of only the containers and/or services provided on
  the command-line without affecting dependencies or dependents with the
  new -o flag

Maestro 0.1.1
-------------

_November 25th, 2013_

* Improved output display
* Correctly show already up/already down containers when starting/stopping
  services and containers
* Add documentation for the guest utils functions
* Automatic pulling of missing images

Maestro 0.1.0
-------------

_November 21st, 2013_

Initial Maestro version with the basic orchestration features
implemented. Environment description, dependency management and basic
start/stop orchestration scores.

Maestro 0.1.0 is also the first version that provides the guestutils
helper functions.
